<h1>  INVERTER NIGERIA LIMITED</h1>

<body>
    <P>An inverter is an electrical devie that converts the DC voltage to an AC voltage. in most cases, the input DC voltage is usually lower while the output AC is equal to the grid supply voltage of either 120 volts, or 240 volts depending on the country.<br><br>The inverter may be built as standalone equipment for applications such as solar power, or to work as a backup power supply from battries which are charged separately.<br><br>The other confoguration is when it is a part of a bigger circuit such as a power supply unit, or a UPS. In this case the inverter input DC is from the rectified mains AC in the PSU, while form either the rectified AC inthe UPS when there is power, and From the battereies whenever there is a power failure.<div>There are many types of inverters based on the shape of the switching waveform. These have varying circuit configurations, efficiencies, abvantages and disadvantages.</div> <div><br>An inverter provides an AC voltage From DC power sources and is useful in powering electronics and electrical equipment rated at the ac mains voltage.In addition they are widely in the switched mode power supplies inverteing shapes. The circuits are classified according to the switching technology and switch type, the waveform, the frequency and output waveform</div>.</P>
    <h2>Basic Inverter Operation</h2>
    <p>The basic circuit includes an oscillator, control circuit, driver circuit for the power devices, and a transformer.<br><br>The conversion of DC to alternating voltage is achieved by converting energy stored in the DC  source such as the battery, or from a rectifier output, into an alternating voltage.This is done using switching devices which are continuously turned on and off, and then stepped up using the transformer. Although there are some configuration which do not use a transformer, these are not widely used.</p>
